### Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:  

**Functional requirements -**  
* **New User Registration:** Any institute member who wants to use the library's services must first register with the system for library resources. The member would receive a user ID and password after successfully registering. For using LIS, he must use these credentials.
* **User login:** User has to login using the ID and password he created during registration. If credentials entered are correct, the 'Home' page is shown from where he can use features of LIS like issue book, return book, reissue book etc. However, if credentials entered are incorrect then the login failure screen should be shown. If an incorrect password is entered three times consecutively then a security question(chosen by the user while registering) with an input box to answer it is shown. Account is blocked on failing to answer security questions as well. Admin can reactivate an account on request.
* **Search book:** Users can search if a book is present in the library using this facility. Book can be searched using its title or author's name or publisher's name.
* **Issue book:** A LIS member can issue a book if:  
i) It is available in the library  
ii) No one else has issued that book  
iii) Member has not issued maximum number of books he can issue  
On successful issue of book user account is updated to reflect the same.
* **Return book:** A book is issued for a finite time. That is, the book should be returned within this time. After returning the book successfully it is shown in the user's account.
